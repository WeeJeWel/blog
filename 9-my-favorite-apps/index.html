  <h1 id="my-favorite-apps">My Favorite Apps</h1>
<p>Great tools make engineering life an order of magnitude better. And they also inspire you to make something great as well. These are my favorite tools.</p>
<h1 id="paw">Paw</h1>
<p>A fantastic HTTP client for macOS with Cloud Sync. The use of tokens is simply great.</p>
<h1 id="tower">Tower</h1>
<p>Git but visual. I really enjoy macOS native apps and this is definitely one.</p>
<h1 id="iterm">iTerm</h1>
<p>A lovely and fast terminal app for macOS.</p>
<h1 id="sketch">Sketch</h1>
<p>Design with a coder's mindset. Try it. Also macOS native so it really feels fluent.</p>
<h1 id="step-two">Step Two</h1>
<p>The most beaurtiful 2FA Tokens app I've ever used. Syncs your tokens between iOS and macOS using iCloud.</p>
<h1 id="newsify">Newsify</h1>
<p>A great RSS Reader that combines multiple sources in one app. You guessed it, macOS native!</p>
<h1 id="vs-code">VS Code</h1>
<p>It's a good editor. Doesn't feel very native and I don't like the Microsoft feel of it. But the ecosystem of extensions is simply amazing. Extensions I use are Docker, MongoDB, GitLens, ESLint, GitHub Actions &amp; AWS.</p>
<h1 id="handbrake">HandBrake</h1>
<p>The UI feels very open-sourcey but it does a great job at converting any video for web.</p>
<h1 id="studio-3t">Studio 3T</h1>
<p>Absolutely the best MongoDB client there is, but oh-my-god the interface feels so sluggish.</p>
<h1 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h1>
<p>An engineer's best friend for installing Linux-like tools on macOS.</p>
<h1 id="icloud-keychain">iCloud Keychain</h1>
<p>I use Safari daily, to this is the best password manager for me. No need to buy anything else really.</p>
<h1 id="proxyman">ProxyMan</h1>
<p>If you ever need to do HTTP(S) sniffing from iOS or macOS, ProxyMan is a great MITM-proxy there is.</p>
