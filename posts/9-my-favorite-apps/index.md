# My Favorite Apps

Great tools make engineering life an order of magnitude better. And they also inspire you to make something great as well. These are my favorite tools.

# Paw

A fantastic HTTP client for macOS with Cloud Sync. The use of tokens is simply great.

# Tower

Git but visual. I really enjoy macOS native apps and this is definitely one.

# iTerm

A lovely and fast terminal app for macOS.

# Sketch

Design with a coder's mindset. Try it. Also macOS native so it really feels fluent.

# Step Two

The most beaurtiful 2FA Tokens app I've ever used. Syncs your tokens between iOS and macOS using iCloud.

# Newsify

A great RSS Reader that combines multiple sources in one app. You guessed it, macOS native!

# VS Code

It's a good editor. Doesn't feel very native and I don't like the Microsoft feel of it. But the ecosystem of extensions is simply amazing. Extensions I use are Docker, MongoDB, GitLens, ESLint, GitHub Actions & AWS.

# HandBrake

The UI feels very open-sourcey but it does a great job at converting any video for web.

# Studio 3T

Absolutely the best MongoDB client there is, but oh-my-god the interface feels so sluggish.

# Homebrew

An engineer's best friend for installing Linux-like tools on macOS.

# iCloud Keychain

I use Safari daily, to this is the best password manager for me. No need to buy anything else really.

# ProxyMan

If you ever need to do HTTP(S) sniffing from iOS or macOS, ProxyMan is a great MITM-proxy.
